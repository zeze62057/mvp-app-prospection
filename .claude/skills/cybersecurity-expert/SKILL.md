# Cybersecurity Expert

Build comprehensive cybersecurity solutions including threat detection, incident response, vulnerability management, and security compliance monitoring.

## Learning Objectives

- Master security information and event management (SIEM)
- Understand threat detection and incident response
- Implement vulnerability management programs
- Apply security compliance frameworks
- Navigate security operations center (SOC) workflows

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of network security fundamentals
- Knowledge of security frameworks and standards
- Familiarity with common attack vectors
- Experience with security tools and technologies

## Core Concepts

### Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)

Centralized platforms that aggregate, analyze, and correlate security logs and events from across infrastructure to detect threats, investigate incidents, and maintain compliance.

### Threat Detection & Intelligence

Proactive identification of security threats using behavioral analysis, indicators of compromise (IOCs), threat feeds, and machine learning to detect anomalies and potential attacks.

### Incident Response

Structured approach to handling security breaches and cyberattacks including preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

### Vulnerability Management

Systematic identification, classification, prioritization, remediation, and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and infrastructure.

### Security Compliance

Ensuring organizational adherence to security standards and regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001 through controls, audits, and documentation.

## Best Practices

### SIEM Operations

- Centralize log collection from all critical systems
- Normalize and enrich event data
- Define clear alert escalation criteria
- Tune correlation rules to reduce false positives
- Maintain threat intelligence feeds
- Regular review and update of detection rules
- Archive logs for forensic analysis

### Incident Response

- Maintain documented IR playbooks
- Conduct regular tabletop exercises
- Establish clear escalation procedures
- Preserve forensic evidence properly
- Document all actions taken
- Conduct post-incident reviews
- Update procedures based on lessons learned

### Vulnerability Management

- Continuous asset discovery and inventory
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Risk-based prioritization (not just severity)
- Track remediation progress and SLAs
- Coordinate with change management
- Verify remediation effectiveness
- Exception handling for accepted risks

### Security Compliance

- Map controls to regulatory requirements
- Maintain evidence documentation
- Automate compliance monitoring where possible
- Regular internal audits
- Track control effectiveness
- Prepare for external audits
- Continuous improvement of security posture

## Anti-Patterns

### Poor Practices

- Alert fatigue from untuned detection rules
- Lack of documented incident procedures
- Ignoring low/medium severity vulnerabilities
- No asset inventory or ownership
- Compliance as checkbox exercise
- Inadequate logging and monitoring
- No security awareness training
- Reactive vs proactive security

### Common Mistakes

- Not validating security alerts
- Delayed incident response
- Inadequate forensic preservation
- Patch management without testing
- Security tools without proper configuration
- Ignoring insider threats
- Insufficient privilege management
- No security metrics or reporting
